# Token-Based Subscription Contract

## Vision

The **Token-Based Subscription Contract** enables a decentralized subscription model where users can pay for services using ERC20 tokens. This smart contract allows users to subscribe for a specified duration by transferring tokens, and it maintains subscription status and expiry for each user. It aims to simplify subscription management, ensure transparent payments, and integrate seamlessly with various ERC20 tokens for a broad range of applications.

## Flowchart

```plaintext
+-----------------+
|  User           |
| (Paying with    |
|  ERC20 tokens)  |
+-----------------+
        |
        | Call `subscribe()`
        v
+--------------------------+
| TokenBasedSubscription   |
| Contract                  |
| - Check token balance     |
| - Transfer tokens         |
| - Update subscription     |
|   expiry date             |
+--------------------------+
        |
        | Emits `Subscribed` event
        v
+--------------------------+
|    Contract Storage      |
| - tokenAddress           |
| - subscriptionFee        |
| - subscriptionDuration   |
| - subscriptionExpiry     |
+--------------------------+
        |
        | Call `isSubscribed()` or `getSubscriptionExpiry()`
        v
+-----------------+
|  User           |
| (Check status   |
|  or expiry date)|
+-----------------+
```

## Contract Address

The contract address will be provided upon deployment of the `TokenBasedSubscription` contract on the Ethereum network. Ensure to verify the contract address and details before interacting with the contract to avoid any issues.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Implement subscription renewal functionality.
   - Add support for multiple token types and payment methods.
   - Introduce a mechanism for pausing or resuming subscriptions.

2. **User Management:**
   - Implement a whitelist or role-based access control for subscription management.
   - Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the contract.

3. **Integration:**
   - Integrate with dApps or platforms requiring subscription services.
   - Provide APIs for off-chain applications to interact with the contract.

4. **Security:**
   - Conduct thorough security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
   - Implement additional security features such as emergency withdrawal functions.
